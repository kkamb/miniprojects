    "Now, to answer a more complicated question -- which cuisines tend to have a disproportionate number of what which violations? Some notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) More popular cuisine categories will tend to have more violations just because they represent more restaurants. Similarly, some violations are more common.  For example, knowing that \"Equipment not easily movable or sealed to floor\" is a common violation for Chinese restuarants is not particularly helpful when it is a common violation for all restaurants. The right quantity is to look at is the conditional probability of a specific type of violation given a specific cuisine type and divide it by the unconditional probability of the violation for the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The definition of a violation changes with time.  For example, 10A can mean two different things \"Toilet facility not maintained ...\" or \"Vermin or other live animal present ...\" when things were prior to 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The ratios don't mean much when the number of violations of a given type and for a specific category are not large, so I filtered them out (using 100 as a somewhat arbitrary threshold)."
